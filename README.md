# Inverse-Design-of-a-U-Slot-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna
An ML model where you input the desired performance and it outputs the physical dimensions.

This is the standard "holy grail" problem in antenna engineering.The Problem: Engineers usually know what result they want (e.g., "I need 2.4 GHz resonance with 100MHz bandwidth"), but they don't know the physical dimensions to get there. They waste hours sweeping parameters in CST/HFSS.The Solution: An ML model where you input the desired performance and it outputs the physical dimensions.1. The Antenna Geometry (Keep it manageable)Don't use a simple rectangular patch. Use a Microstrip Patch with a U-Slot or a Defected Ground Structure (DGS).Why? Because adding a slot makes the physics non-linear. Simple equations break down here, so an ML model becomes the only fast way to predict dimensions.2. The Parameters (What to predict)This is an Inverse Regression problem.Inputs (Features - What you want):Target Resonance Frequency ($f_r$) in GHz.Target Bandwidth (BW) or $S_{11}$ bandwidth.Target Gain (in dBi).(Optional) Dielectric Constant of substrate ($\epsilon_r$) – Only if you plan to vary the material.Outputs (Labels - What the model predicts):Patch Length ($L_p$).Patch Width ($W_p$).Slot Length ($L_s$) and Slot Width ($W_s$).Feed Position ($X_f, Y_f$).3. The Real Benefit (Research Value)Speed: An EM simulator (HFSS/CST) takes 2-10 minutes per simulation. Your trained model will give an answer in 0.001 seconds. This "Real-time Synthesis" is huge for rapid prototyping.Optimization: You can use this model as a "Surrogate" inside a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize antennas 1000x faster than linking GA directly to HFSS.
